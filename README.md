‚ö†Ô∏è This project is still a bit of a work in progress, with the eventual goal of showing the user the different steps that are taken to calculate the curvature of these different parametric equations. I'm also planning on implementing a playground of sorts, where the user can input their own curve and see how the curvature changes over time. This is all for a project in my AP Calculus class, so the goal is to have these extra features done by the project due date on May 24th.

I'd love to hear any feedback on how I'd be able to improve this site! My contact information is on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/zsrobinson), and you can always just submit an issue on this project directly.

Lastly, thanks to the wonderful contributors to the [Mafs](https://mafs.dev/) React library, whom this project would not be possible without. This library is a great tool for visualizing different concepts in the world of math, and their [docs](https://mafs.dev/guides/examples/bezier-curves) do a great job at demonstrating this. Oh, and also thanks to my calculus teacher for letting me do this project instead of one of the more standard options we had for our final!
